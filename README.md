# Barn simulation

https://klandermans.github.io/barnsimulation/

This project is a Three.js scene that simulates a barn with moving "cows" (cubes) and rows of static "ricbin blocks" (blue cubes). The barn structure includes walls, a saddle roof, and interactive lighting effects. The cows avoid collisions with each other and the ricbin blocks, and the entire scene is illuminated by a point light. Shadows are rendered dynamically to add depth and realism.

## Features

- Interactive 3D scene rendered with Three.js.
- Dynamic movement of cow-like cubes that avoid collisions.
- Real-time lighting and shadow rendering for added depth.
- Transparent walls and saddle roof.
- Customizable floor, walls, and roof materials.
- Two rows of static blue blocks ("ricbin blocks") in the barn.

## Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the `index.html` file:

- **Cow movement speed**: Change the `cubeSpeed` variable to control the speed of the cubes.
- **Number of cows**: Adjust the number of cubes by modifying the loop that generates them.
- **Lighting**: Add more lights or change the color/intensity of the existing lights.

Feel free to experiment with other Three.js features and customize the scene as you like!
